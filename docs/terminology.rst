  “Standardized terminology should be used when defining ages and comparing
  outcomes of fetuses and newborns. The recommended terms are:

  Gestational age (completed weeks): time elapsed between the first day of the
last menstrual period and the day of delivery. If pregnancy was achieved using
  assisted reproductive technology, gestational age is calculated by adding 2
  weeks to the conceptional age.

  Chronological age (days, weeks, months, or  years): time
elapsed from birth.

  Postmenstrual age (weeks): gestational age plus
chronological age.

  Corrected age (weeks or months): chronological age reduced by
the number of weeks born before 40 weeks of gestation; the term should be used
only for children up to 3 years of age who were born preterm.

**During the perinatal period neonatal hospital stay, “postmenstrual age” is
preferred to describe the age of preterm infants. After the perinatal period,
“corrected age” is the preferred term.  “Conceptional age,” “postconceptional
age,” “conceptual age,” and “postconceptual age” should not be used in clinical
pediatrics.
